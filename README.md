# OctreeMesh

OCTREEMESH v310122
Please take a look at documentation and examples in HOW_TO folder

## Using `environment.yml` with micromamba

From the repository root:

```bash
micromamba env create -f environment.yml
micromamba activate octreemesh
```

Build the project in that environment:

```bash
make
```

If you update dependencies in `environment.yml`, recreate the env:

```bash
micromamba env remove -n octreemesh
micromamba env create -f environment.yml
micromamba activate octreemesh
```

Quick sanity checks after activation:

```bash
which g++
which gfortran
g++ --version
```

To verify OpenMP support from the activated environment:

```bash
echo '#include <omp.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main(){printf("%d\\n", omp_get_max_threads());}' > /tmp/omp_test.c
gcc -fopenmp /tmp/omp_test.c -o /tmp/omp_test && /tmp/omp_test
```


# High-level architecture

This repo is a pipeline for viral capsid meshing + FEM solve + back-interpolation to PDB:
extract_ATOM (from CLEANER) filters ATOM/amino-acid records from .vdb.
octree_mesh (from MESHER) builds octree hexahedral mesh and solver input files.
(optional) shear_rotate (from ROTATOR) rotates geometry for shear setups.
meshsolver (renamed Solid binary from SOLVER) runs FEM and writes .post.res.
mesh2pdb (from CREATES_PDB) interpolates element/node results back to atoms in PDB.
apply-matrix.awk rotates output PDB back to original orientation in the example script.
The top-level makefile wires exactly these binaries and names in ./bin.

# What each executable does
1) extract_ATOM (CLEANER/cleaner)
Purpose: reads an input .vdb/PDB-like text file, keeps only ATOM records that belong to amino-acid residues (ALA, ARG, ...), writes filtered output.
Inputs: <input_vdb> <output_vdb> (2 args after program name).
Outputs: filtered atom-only text file used by mesher.
How: parses fixed-width columns, checks record type + residue token, writes matching lines.
Parallelized? No (single-threaded C++ without OpenMP pragmas).
2) octree_mesh (MESHER/output/mesher)
Purpose: builds capsid volumetric mesh and FEM input data.
Inputs (13 args after exe): vdb file, T-number, solution type, resolution, fold/id alignment, vector (x,y,z), virus id, cone angle, load proportion variation, Young’s modulus scaling.
Outputs: mesh/problem/solver files consumed by FEM solver (and other intermediate files).
How: main flow is ReadVdbFile -> refinement/percentages -> local root atom assignment -> octree refine -> set loaded/fixed elements -> print FEM data files.
Parallelized? Compiled with -fopenmp, but I found no OpenMP pragmas in MESHER sources; practically appears single-threaded in this module.
3) shear_rotate (ROTATOR/rotator)
Purpose: rotates a FEM geometry mesh (90° around X) for shear mode.
Inputs: <input.geometry.dat> <output.geometry.dat>.
Outputs: rotated geometry file in same FEM format.
How: reads node/element counts + connectivity, applies rotation matrix to node coordinates, rewrites mesh.
Parallelized? No (single-threaded).
4) meshsolver (copied from SOLVER/gid/problemtypes/Solid.gid/Solid)
Purpose: the structural FEM solve stage used by OctreeMesh.
Inputs: <problem_prefix> [log_level] [log_file], where it expects:
<prefix>.solver.dat
<prefix>.geometry.dat
<prefix>.problem.dat
Outputs: <prefix>.post.res (GiD results), optionally <prefix>.post.mat.
How: loads solver settings + geometry + materials, assembles global system(s), runs selected solver, writes GiD results.
Parallelized? Yes, SOLVER is OpenMP-enabled (-fopenmp) and solver kernels use many #pragma omp parallel for loops.
5) mesh2pdb (CREATES_PDB/output/pdb)
Purpose: interpolates FEM results back onto atoms and writes a PDB with result fields in Occupancy/TempFactor columns.
Inputs: <input_vdb> <mesh.post.msh> <mesh.post.res> <output.pdb> <refinement_level>.
Outputs: result-annotated PDB.
How: translates nodal results, assigns atoms and hexahedra to local octree root, refines search tree, interpolates to atoms, saves.
Parallelized? Compiled with -fopenmp, but like MESHER, no explicit OpenMP pragmas found in this module.
Other executables under SOLVER (not core OctreeMesh pipeline, but present)
SOLVER/build/gcc/Makefile builds libraries, tools, examples, and problem binaries (Solid, Heat, etc.).

# Key tool binaries:

FEMSolver: pipe-based FE system assembly/solve service (FEMData/FEMResult named pipes).
EqnSolver: pipe-based sparse equation solver service (EqnData/EqnResult).
MatSolver: solves A*x=b from MAT-file (A and b in, x out).
Diff: subtracts two .post.res files and writes diff results.

# Inputs/outputs across the full OctreeMesh pipeline
Using HOW_TO/run.sh and top-level makefile naming:
Input structural file: ${VDB}.vdb
extract_ATOM output: ${VDB}_ATOMS.vdb
octree_mesh outputs include ${name}.geometry.dat, ${name}.problem.dat, ${name}.solver.dat, ${name}.post.msh/intermediates
meshsolver output: ${name}.post.res + solver log redirection
mesh2pdb output: ${PDB_results}
apply-matrix.awk output: ${PDB_back}
Final renamed outputs for visualization: ${resn}.post.res, ${resn}.post.msh, ${resn}_back.pdb.

# Installation / compile / run (practical)
Prereqs
make, g++
gfortran (required by solver build flags)
OpenMP-capable compiler/runtime (-fopenmp)
shell tools in script path: gunzip, awk

Compile everything
From repo root:
make
This builds each module and copies user-facing binaries into ./bin:
extract_ATOM
octree_mesh
shear_rotate
meshsolver
mesh2pdb

Run
Preferred method is editing and running HOW_TO/run.sh:
Set parameters (virus ID, fold vector, resolution, BIN path).
chmod u+x run.sh
./run.sh

The sample output in HOW_TO/README documents expected stage-by-stage progress and resulting files. 

# Parallelization summary
Definitely parallelized: SOLVER core and tool internals (OpenMP loops in solver kernels; OpenMP sections for pipe setup in tool frontends).
Compiled with OpenMP but no explicit pragmas found in these modules: MESHER and CREATES_PDB.
Not parallelized: CLEANER and ROTATOR.

To compile this repo for multithreaded execution, you mainly need to ensure OpenMP is enabled at build time (it is, by default) and then set runtime thread counts for solver binaries.

1) Compile with OpenMP (already configured)

The relevant makefiles already include -fopenmp:
MESHER uses -fopenmp in both compile and link flags. 
CREATES_PDB uses -fopenmp in both compile and link flags. 
SOLVER build flags include -fopenmp for C++ builds in debug/release. 
So a normal build from repo root is enough:
make
Top-level make builds all subprojects and produces bin/* wrappers. 

2) Build parallelism vs runtime parallelism

There are two different “multithread” knobs:
Build parallelism (how fast compilation runs): in SOLVER/build/gcc/Makefile, PARALLEL=4 and sub-builds use make -j $(PARALLEL). 
Runtime parallelism (how many threads the solver uses while solving): controlled by environment variables like SOLVER_THREADS. 

3) Set runtime solver threads

For solver tools/scripts, increase threads by setting:
export SOLVER_THREADS=<N>
The provided runner defaults to 1, so change it there or export before execution. 
Example:

export SOLVER_THREADS=8
./bin/meshsolver octreemesh 2

4) Confirm solver code actually uses OpenMP

Yes — solver kernels contain OpenMP loops with num_threads(threads), e.g. conjugate gradient.

Practical recommendation

Build normally with make (OpenMP already enabled). 
For actual speedup, tune SOLVER_THREADS to your core count (start with physical cores, then benchmark). 
If you want faster compilation, increase PARALLEL in SOLVER/build/gcc/Makefile or call make -j.
